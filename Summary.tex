\begin{abstract}
Microwave (MW) interactions with high-lying Rydberg states have been successfully described using a classical electron orbit model. Electron recombination and phase-dependent ionization have been described by one-dimensional single-half-MW-cycle and then single-electron-orbit models. To accurately describe phase-dependent ionization in a static field, we have expanded the model to two dimensions and multiple orbits. This summary describes the concepts of near-ionization-threshold electron orbits in strong MW and weak static fields and the mathematical model used.

\section{\label{sec:State} Explicit Statement of Model}

\subsection{\label{sec:AU} Atomic Units}

Calculations are simplified by using atomic units. Useful atomic units, found in Rydberg Atoms by Tom Gallagher \emph{(CITE)}

\begin{align*}
\text{Energy} & & E_{AU} & & & 4.35974417 \cdot 10^{-18} ~ \text{J} \\
\text{Time} & & t_{AU} & & & 2.418884326505 \cdot 10^{-17} ~ \text{s} \\
\text{Field} & & f_{AU} & & & 5.14220652 \cdot 10^{11} ~ \text{V/m}
\end{align*}

After calculations, it's useful to transform back to lab units.

\begin{align*}
\text{1 GHz} & = 1.51983 \cdot 10^{-7} ~ E_{AU} \\
\text{1 ns} & = 4.13414 \cdot 10^7 ~ t_{AU} \\
\text{1 mV/cm} & = 1.94469 \cdot 10^{-13} ~ f_{AU}
\end{align*}

\subsection{\label{sec:IC} Initial Conditions}

Experimental parameters provide the initial energy $E_0$ and angular momentum $L_0$. This is further constrained by the choice to start at the periapsis of a Keplerean trajectory.

The system of equations for the initial conditions are
\begin{align*}
E_0 & = \frac{1}{2} v_0^2 - \frac{1}{r_0} & L_0 & = r_0 \cdot v_0
\end{align*}
which has two solutions representing the peri- and apoapsis. Excitation from the 3D state suggests periapsis initial conditions.
\begin{align*}
r_0 & = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 2 E_0 L_0^2}}{2 E_0} & v_0 & = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 2 E_0 L_0^2}}{L_0}
\end{align*}
These initial conditions need to be mapped onto the angle of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) vector in the x-z plane, and the selection of the angular momentum in the $\pm \hat{y}$ direction. This is implemented by starting with $\theta_{LRL} = 0$ and $\hat{L} = \pm \hat{y}$ and then rotating $\vec{r}_0, \vec{v}_0$.
\begin{align*}
& & x(0) & = \sin{\theta_{LRL}} \cdot r_0 & z(0) & = -\cos{\theta_{LRL}} \cdot r_0 \\
\hat{L} & = \pm \hat{y} & \dot{x}(0) & = \pm \cos{\theta_{LRL}} \cdot v_0 & \dot{z}(0) & = \pm \sin{\theta_{LRL}} \cdot v_0
\end{align*}

\subsection{\label{sec:EoM} Equations of Motion}

The equations of motion must include the Coulomb potential, applied pulsed field, and microwave field. The vector statement of the equations of motion, in atomic units, is

\begin{align*}
\ddot{\vec{r}} & = F_{coul}(\vec{r}) - \vec{E}_{P}(t) - \vec{E}_{MW}(t) \\
 & = -\frac{1}{r^2} \cdot \hat{r} - \Phi_P(t) \cdot E_{p} \cdot \hat{z} - \Phi_{MW}(t) \cdot E_{mw} \sin{(\omega t + \phi_0)} \cdot \hat{z} 
\end{align*}
where the $\Phi_P$ and $\Phi_{MW}$ are envelope functions describing the square wave turning off the pulsed field and the exponential ringdown of the MW field.

\begin{align*}
\Phi_P(t \leq t_{off}) & = 1 & \Phi_{MW}(t \leq t_{off}) & = 1 \\
\Phi_P(t > t_{off}) & = 0 & \Phi_{MW}(t > t_{off}) & = e^{-(t-t_{off})/\tau_{MW}}
\end{align*}

For computation, these vector equations need to be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates \{x,y,z\}. Including the initial conditions from Sec.~\ref{sec:IC}, the system of ODEs is:
\begin{align*}
x(0) & = \sin{\theta_{LRL}} \cdot r_0 & z(0) & = -\cos{\theta_{LRL}} \cdot r_0 \\
\dot{x}(0) & = \pm \cos{\theta_{LRL}} \cdot v_0 & \dot{z}(0) & = \pm \sin{\theta_{LRL}} \cdot v_0 \quad \text{for} \quad \hat{L} = \pm \hat{y} \\
\ddot{x} & = -\frac{x}{(x^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} & \ddot{z} & = -\frac{z}{(x^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} - \Phi_P(t) \cdot E_P \\
 & & & \quad \quad - \Phi_{MW}(t) \cdot E_{MW} \cdot \sin{(\omega t + \phi_0)}
\end{align*}

\section{\label{sec:Tests} Tests}

\subsection{\label{sec:ThL} $\Theta_{LRL}$ and $\hat{L}$}

Fig.~\ref{fig:ThL} shows changing the initial conditions for $\hat{L}$ and $\theta_{LRL}$ produces the desired orbits.

\end{figure}

\subsection{\label{sec:EvP} $\Delta$ E vs $\phi_0$}

To measure $\Delta E(\phi_0)$, I ran the model in zero static field for 30 MW cycles, and took an average of the orbital energy over cycles 10 through 20. This showed a $<1 ~ GHz$ disagreement with running the simulation for 100 ns and averaging over the final 10 cycles.
\begin{equation*}
E_f = \frac{1}{10T_{MW}} \int_{10T_{MW}}^{20T_{MW}} \left(\frac{v(t)^2}{2} - \frac{1}{r(t)}\right) \cdot dt
\end{equation*}

Carrat, 2015 shows the 1-D analytical theory predicts a maximum energy transfer of
\begin{equation*}
\Delta E_{\pi/6} = \frac{3}{2} \frac{E_{MW}}{\omega^{2/3}}
\end{equation*}
I've tested this on three microwave field values of $E_{MW} = 2, ~ 4, ~ \text{and} ~ 6 ~ V/cm$ at initial energies of $E_0 = 0, ~ 100, ~ \text{and} ~ 200 ~ GHz$. The test at the ionization limit agrees well, while those further from the limit are less accurate.

Beyond maximum energy transfer, the model shows very good agreement to a sinusoidal dependence.
\begin{align*}
\Delta E(\phi_0) & = A \cdot \cos{(\phi_0 - \Delta \phi)} & A & = \frac{3}{2} \frac{E_{MW}}{\omega^{2/3}} & \Delta \phi & = \frac{\pi}{6}
\end{align*}
where $\phi_0$ refers to the excitation phase of the MW field
\begin{equation*}
\vec{E}_{MW}(t) = E_{MW} \sin{(\omega t + \phi_0)} \cdot \hat{z}
\end{equation*}
For $E_0 = 0 ~ GHz$, Table~\ref{tab:EvP} shows the parameters predicted by theory and the parameters fit to the computational model, showing good agreement. For the same conditions, Fig.~\ref{fig:EvP} shows the computed final energies in color traced with the theory predictions in black.

	\begin{ruledtabular}
	\begin{tabular}{c|cc|cc}
	$E_{MW}$ (V/cm) & $A_{pred}$ (GHz) & $A_{comp}$ (GHz) & $\Delta \phi_{pred}$ (rad.) & $\Delta \phi_{comp}$ (rad.) \\ \hline
	2.0 & 21.317 & 21.172 & 0.524 & 0.523 \\
	4.0 & 42.633 & 42.349 & 0.524 & 0.523 \\
	6.0 & 63.949 & 63.543 & 0.524 & 0.523

	\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{EvP}
	\caption{\label{fig:EvP} Total energy gained by the electron $(\Delta E)$ from the MW field as it leaves the core at a particular MW phase $(\phi_0)$. The results of the computational model are points in color, and the theory prediction of $\Delta E = 3/2 \cdot E_{MW}/\omega^{3/2} \cdot \cos{(\phi_0 + \Delta\phi)}$ is traced as a solid black line, showing good agreement.}
\end{figure}

The case for a slingshotting electron is not quite double that for an electron leaving the core. If the closest approach occurs at $\phi_0$, then the energy gain arriving can be treated as energy lost by an electron leaving at $\phi_0$ in an electric field evolving backwards in time.
\begin{align*}
E_{MW}(-t,\phi_0) & = A \sin{(-\omega t + \phi_0)} \\
 & = -A\sin({\omega t - \phi_0)} \\
 & = -E_{MW}(t, -\phi_0)
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\Delta E_{slingshot} & = \Delta E(\phi_0) - -\Delta E(-\phi_0) \\
 & = \Delta E(\phi_0) + \Delta E(-\phi_0) \\
 & = A \cos{(\phi_0 - \Delta \phi)} + A \cos{(-\phi_0 - \Delta \phi)} \\
 & = 2 A \cos{\phi_0} \cos{\Delta \phi}
\end{align*}
For $\Delta \phi = \pi/6$, this suggests a maximum "slingshot" exchange of
\begin{equation*}
\Delta E_{slingshot,max} = \sqrt{3} A = \sqrt{3} \, \frac{3}{2} \frac{E_{MW}}{\omega^{2/3}}
\end{equation*}

\section{\label{sec:static} Uphill and Downhill Electrons in Static Fields}

\emph{There's lots to say here, look at the 1D model and turning time calculations.}

\section{\label{sec:Err} Error Correction}

There are plenty of details involved in turning the equations stated in Sec~\ref{sec:EoM} into a computation. I've elected to use Mathematica for simplicity, although I have some regrets. The equations of motion are passed off to \texttt{NDSolve[]} using \texttt{PrecisionGoal->13} and \texttt{AccuracyGoal->13} to ensure a MW and pulsed field-free orbit conserves energy up to $< 0.01$ GHz. The solver is asked to solve for $t_i = 0$ ns to $t_f = (20~\text{ns}) + 5\tau_{MW} = 70$ ns. This is done for all possible combinations of the following parameters:
\begin{align*}
W_0 & = \{0,~ -20\}~\text{GHz} \\
E_p & = \{0,~ 7.2,~ 14.4,~ 21.6,~ 28.8,~ 36.0,~ 43.2,~ 57.6,~ 72.0,~ 86.4,~ 100.8,~ \\
 & \quad \quad 115.2,~ 144.0,~ 172.8,~ 187.2,~ 201.6,~ 230.4,~ 259.2,~ 288.0\}~\text{mV/cm} \\
\theta_{LRL} & = \{0,~ \pi\} \\
\hat{L} & = \{-1,~ 1\}~\hat{y} \\
\phi_0 & = \{0,~ \frac{1}{100} \pi,~ \frac{2}{100} \pi, \ldots, \frac{198}{100} \pi,~ \frac{199}{100} \pi\}
\end{align*}
For a particular $W_0,~ E_p$, this takes 4 hours on the lab computer running all 4 cores. Some back of the envelope estimation gives 114 hours, or 5 days, of runtime for the full data set.

Approximately 92\% of these run successfully, in which case the final energy is saved. The other 8\% return some error in \texttt{NDSolve[]}. Looking at these errors, 8\% aren't errors when re-run (\emph{why?}) and 12.5\% reach the maximum number of steps set for \texttt{NDSolve[]}. The remaining 79.5\% return an error when the integrator step size is too small, due to the electron slamming straight into the $1/r$ singularity. For the ``No Error'' case I can just fill in the \texttt{NaN} final energy with the new result, and for the ``Max Steps'' case I can simply restart at the end state and continue until $t_{max}$ is finally reached. The ``Step Size is 0'' case is more complicated.

\subsection{\label{sec:ssing} Skipping the Singularity}

One solution is to ``skip over'' the singularity. In our regime of electron energies and field strengths, we know the model is roughly separable into interactions with the core and the MW field where the pulsed field is negligible, and interactions with the core and pulsed field where the MW field effects average out over cycles. With this in mind, when the Coulomb singularity becomes a problem, it can be skipped over by making this separation explicit.

The pseudo-recipe for skipping the singularity when \texttt{NDSolve[]} returns a step size error is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Take final electron state information ($\vec{r}(t_{F}), \vec{v}(t_{F}, W(t_{F})$) from a time $t_F$ slightly before the error.
	\item Use the time of the error $t_E$ as the slingshot time and get the slingshot phase $\phi_s$. From this, change the electron energy can be found from Sec.~\ref{sec:EvP}:  $\Delta W_{s} = \sqrt{3} ~ (3/2) ~ (E_{MW}/\omega^{2/3}) ~ \cos{\phi_s}$.
	\item Re-launch the solver with new initial conditions assuming the approach to the core and the escape from the core are symmetric, except the energy and therefore velocity has changed. \begin{align*}
	\vec{r}(t_i) & = \vec{r}(t_F) \\
	W(t_i) & = W(t_F) + \Delta W_s(\phi_s) \\
	\vec{v}(t_i) & = v(W(t_i), \vec{r}(t_i)) \cdot -\hat{v}(t_f)
	\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

The obvious hangup with this simple recipe is that, close to the core, The MW field produces very large energy oscillations. If the simulation is blindly switched from $t_F$ to $t_i$ without being aware of what phase of the energy oscillations each time represents, a large amount of unwanted energy transfer can occur. Fig.~\ref{fig:oscsling} shows a detailed look at the energy oscillations as an electron swings around the core, and suggests a solution to this problem.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{computation/oscillations_slingshot}
\caption{\label{fig:oscsling} A close up look at Energy vs Time for an electron ``slingshotting'' around the core. The red lines mark the slingshot time $t_s$, one MW cycle in either direction $t_s \pm 1/f_{MW}$, and the nearest extrema of the MW field beyond one MW cycle, showing a point where the energy oscillations are at their time-averaged value. This particular run is executed with $E_{MW} = 4$ V/cm, $E_p = 0$ mV/cm, $W_0 = -28$ GHz, $dL = +1$, $\theta_{LRL} = 0$, and $\phi_0 = 4/6 ~ \pi$.}
\end{figure}

As should be expected, the energy oscillations are exactly $\pi/2$ out of phase with the MW field. This suggests stopping and starting the electron at extrma of the MW field will lead to zero net energy transfer. To make sure the large energy exchange near the core doesn't mess up results these extrema should be chosen at least 1 MW period away from $t_s$. Using this logic, we get stopping and starting times:
\begin{align*}
\phi_{off} & = \left( t_s \omega_{MW} + \phi_0 +\pi/2 \right) ~mod~ \pi \\
t_F & = t_s - \frac{2\pi + \phi_{off}}{\omega_{MW}} \\
t_i & = t_s + \frac{2\pi + \pi - \phi_{off}}{\omega_{MW}}
\end{align*}
There is $2\phi_{off} \omega_{MW}$ of ``lost time'', but this aught not be significant compared to the total integration time for all but the most pathological cases.
